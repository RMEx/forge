## Run the application

- `npm` must be installed
- `npm install` to fetch the dependancies
- `npm run build` to build the pre-built application
-  after installing dependencies, you can just run `npm run start` (for building and running)

If you have any issues with `elm-make`, you can use `npm install -g elm`
to install elm, globally.
